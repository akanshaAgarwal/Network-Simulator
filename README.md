# Network-Simulator
A simulated model which demonstrates the working of the TCP/IP Networking Model as a whole 
This project shows proper working of the whole Network using GUI and Applets.
TCP/IP Networking model consistes of 4 basic layers :
1) Application Layer
2) Transport Layer
3) Network Layer
5) Data Link + Physical Layer

It depicts the working of each layer in the network model and how data flow takes place between corresponding layers of the Network.
