# Network-Simulator
A simulated model which demonstrates the working of the TCP/IP Networking Model as a whole 
This project shows proper working of the whole Network using GUI and Applets.
TCP/IP Networking model consistes of 4 basic layers :
1) Application Layer
2) Transport Layer
3) Network Layer
5) Data Link + Physical Layer

It depicts the working of each layer in the network model and how data flow takes place between corresponding layers of the Network.

APPLICATION LAYER
Processes implemented:
a) E-mails
b) Sample Search Engine
Protocols used:
a) HTTP
b) SMTP
c) DNS

TRANSPORT LAYER
Used port numbers of various protocols for sending information across networks.

NETWORK LAYER
Routing Protocols used : 
a) Static Routing
b) RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
c) OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

DATA LINK + PHYSICAL LAYER
Error Control used : CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)
Flow Control used : Stop and Wait Protocol
